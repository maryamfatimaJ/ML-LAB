# ML-LAB 🧠

This repository contains Machine Learning Lab work focused on **Data Preprocessing** — a fundamental step before model building. These lab exercises are a part of my university coursework for the BS-AI (Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence) 3rd semester.

## 📊 Lab Topic: Data Preprocessing

The main objective of this lab is to prepare raw data into a clean and usable format. The following preprocessing steps have been implemented:

### ✅ 1. Reading Data
- Loading datasets using Python libraries such as Pandas

### ✅ 2. Exploring Data / Data Insight
- Displaying data shape, summary statistics, and understanding column types

### ✅ 3. Cleansing Data
- Handling missing values
- Dropping irrelevant or duplicate rows

### ✅ 4. Outlier Detection and Removing
- Identifying and removing outliers using statistical techniques (e.g., IQR, Z-score)

### ✅ 5. Data Transformation
- **Normalization**: Scaling values between 0 and 1
- **Rescaling**: Standardizing data for ML models

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizing data and outliers)
- Jupyter Notebook
